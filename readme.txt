ORBIT CE

About:

This program is designed for students and enthusiasts to calculate variables related to orbital mechanics. The app includes the formulas used and allows users to calculate orbital variables using orbital velocity or orbital height as known inputs. Constants for Earth, the Moon, Mars, Jupiter and (fictional) Kerbin are included. There is also a CUSTOM menu option where you can input your own custom variables for Mass, Radius and Gravitational Constant.

This is the CE version of the app and will not function properly on a non-CE screen. You can find a 83+/84 version under the appropriate filing.

Purpose:

This program is primarily for learning. The calculations are purely theoretical and do not include an in-depth and functionally realistic calculation of orbital mechanics. But the physics are proper. The equations create a perfectly circular orbit (which is not realistic) and a constant speed (again, not realistic). But this is great for learning about the variables and understanding how gravity and mass impact an object orbiting a body.

You can test out how the program does relate to reality in the theory. The International Space Station orbits the Earth at ~250km and the speed you get in the program is 7754 which is the average speed of the station in reality (appox. 7km/s). Same for calculating the geostationary orbit height.

Units:

All units are metric and the calculations have been set up for the units specified alongside each input. This is for ease of use. The use of scientific notation is also employed which introduces students to the proper handling of large numbers in Astro calculations.
